### Problem 1: Understanding TDD

Write a program to take a number from the command line.
* If the input is a number fully divisible by 3, it should print out `Fizz`
* If the input is a number fully divisible by 5 it should print out `Buzz`
* If the input is a number fully divisible by 3 and 5 both, it should print `Fizz:Buzz`
* If the input is not a number, it should print `Please enter a number`


### Problem 2: Understanding Single Responsibility Principle

Define a line, and find the length of the line.
